BCG vaccination uptake in Bradfordâ€™s infants

To expand on the rationale: senior paediatricians in Bradford have raised concerns that BCG coverage is falling but this has not been possible to detect in routinely collected national data (although there are hints in a recent, mostly qualitative, paper written by national UKHSA/LSHTM colleagues linked to the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit for vaccination1).
Bradford is specific in that it does not meet national criteria for a universal BCG programme, does have a population which meets BCG vaccination criteria, and prior to September 2021 had an established and well-running neonatal BCG programme.
